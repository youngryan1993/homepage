Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained huge attention as a potential energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their inherent high-sparsity activation. However, most prior SNN methods use forward-only ANN-like architectures (e.g., VGG-Net or ResNet), which could provide sub-optimal performance for temporal sequence processing of binary information in SNNs. To address this, we introduce a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach for finding better SNN architectures.
