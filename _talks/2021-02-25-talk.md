Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as an alternative to deep learning due to their huge energy efficiency benefits on neuromorphic hardware. In this presentation, we suggest important techniques for training SNNs which bring a huge benefit in terms of latency, accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.
