I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Electircal Engineering Department at Yale University. I am the member of [Intelligent Computing Lab](https://intelligentcomputinglab.yale.edu), advised by Prof. [Priyadarshini Panda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qA5WsYUAAAAJ&hl) .
My research aims to build more bio-inspired machine intelligence where the system can achieve both energy-efficiency and robust performance. 
I develop the learning algorithms which facilitate binary communication (like the human brain) in AI systems, while having  hardware-friendly features.
Also, I look into various practical machine learning tasks, such as distributed learning and domain adaptation, enabling learning systems to tackle real-world scenarios.

**[Important] I am looking for a research internship for 2023 summer on Machine Learning (for Energy-efficiency) or Neuromorphic Computing!**
