I am a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs, developing a neural network system to interpret EMG signals for future human-computer interaction. I earned a Ph.D. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Yale University in 2024, advised by Prof. [Priyadarshini Panda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qA5WsYUAAAAJ). I also earned my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University (2018) and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) (2020). I did AI research internships at Kakao Corporation, SK Telecom T-brain, and Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) in South Korea, as well as an Applied Scientist internship at Amazon AWS AI in Seattle, WA. My research interests include developing novel algorithms for efficient machine learning, computer vision, and algorithm-hardware co-design.
