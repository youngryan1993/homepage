I‚Äôm an Applied Scientist at Amazon AWS AI Labs, working on a vision-language model for the AWS Bedrock service. I was previously a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs, where I developed neural network systems to interpret EMG signals for next-generation human-computer interaction. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Yale University in 2024, advised by Prof. [Priyadarshini Panda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qA5WsYUAAAAJ), and received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University in 2018 and my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2020. I‚Äôve also worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon AWS AI in Seattle and completed AI research internships at Kakao Corporation, SK Telecom T-Brain, and Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) in South Korea. My research interests include efficient machine learning algorithms, computer vision, algorithm-hardware co-design, and neuromorphic computing.
